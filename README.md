# Lists and basic data structures

You have to implement all the constructors & methods of the different structures:

* [top] - Returns the top element.
* [front] - Returns the front element.
* [back] - Returns the back element.
* [push] - Adds an element.
* [push_front] - Adds an element to the front.
* [push_back] - Adds an elemento to the back.
* [pop] - Removes an element.
* [pop_front] - Removes the front element, and updates a new front if necessary.
* [pop_back] - Removes the back element, and updates a new back if necessary.
* [operator[]] - Returns an element in a certain position.
* [empty] - If the data structure is empty.
* [size] - The current count of elements.
* [clear] - Remove all the elements.
* [sort] - Sorts the elements, you can use any sorting algorithm.
* [reverse] - Reverts the elements of the structure.
* [empty] - If the data structure is empty.
* [killSelf] - Clears all the elements.
* [begin] - Returns an iterator pointing to the start of the list.
* [end] - Returns an iterator pointing to the next element of the list end.
* [merge] - Transfers all elements.

Moreover, never forget to handle exceptions when necessary! And do not forget the iterators:

* [operator=] - Equals an iterator to another.
* [operator!=] - Returns if the iterator is different from another iterator.
* [operator++] - Advance one position.
* [operator--] - Goes back one position.
* [operator*] - Returns the content of the iterator.
